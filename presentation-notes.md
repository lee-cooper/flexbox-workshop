<p>Anywhere where layout and alignment is needed, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Centering content within a div</li>
          <li>Creating a responsive navigation bar</li>
          <li>Displaying site content dynamically based on screen size</li>

Why

<li>Responsive layouts are much easier with flexbox</li>
          <li>
            Replaces legacy screen layout implementations, such as floats and
            positioning, which were not designed for layout (please don't use
            these anymore)
          </li>
